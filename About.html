		<h2> What is Macra kits ? </h2>
		<p>Introducing our company - Macra Kits! We're on a mission to help consumers form a personal connection with the products they buy, starting with our Macrame Bag Making Kits.

			In today's world, we often purchase products without considering their origin or impact on the environment.Mass-manufactured bags are not only harmful to the planet, but they also violate labor laws and exploit people. On top of that, they lack personalization, making them just another money grab by big corporations.</p>
            <br>
             <p> At Macra Kits, we're changing that. Our Macrame Bag Making Kits are designed to give you a meaningful and creative experience while also reducing your impact on the environment. Our kits provide a better choice for those who want to make a conscious decision about what they buy.
			
			Our target audience is young adults who are looking for a more sustainable and personalized option when it comes to their bags. We know that fast fashion often targets this age group, so we want to provide an alternative that is both stylish and ethical.
			
			Our kits are available online so that people can access them easily from anywhere. We believe that creating something with your own hands is a powerful way to connect with the material world and make a positive impact.
			
			As we design our Macrame Bag Making Kits, we know that time management will be a challenge since our product requires some effort to create. However, we believe that the time invested will be well worth it. We also anticipate that getting our product out there and building credibility will be a challenge, but we are confident that the quality of our product will speak for itself.
			
			At Macra Kits, we're excited to help consumers create a personal connection with their material goods, one Macrame Bag at a time.</p>.
